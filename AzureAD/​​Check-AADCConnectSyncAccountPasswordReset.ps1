When you install Entra ID Connect to sync identities between your on-premises environment and Entra ID, a user named MSOL_[0-9a-f]{12} is created in both directories. This user has broad permissions and is often excluded from security defaults and conditional access policies. If an attacker gains admin access to the Entra ID Connect server, they can extract this user's password and use it to reset passwords or gain access to AAD, particularly if syncing admin accounts with global admin permissions.

In the on-premises environment, the MSOL_ user typically has the ability to reset passwords and read them using DCSync. This access can allow an attacker to obtain the krbtgt password and create golden or silver Kerberos tickets."

Avoid syncing admin accounts between AD and AAD, establish a trust boundary between the directories, and limit the MSOL_ user's capabilities to only necessary organizational units and users. Additionally, follow Microsoftâ€™s hardening recommendations for added security."
